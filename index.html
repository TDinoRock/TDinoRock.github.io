                        Accurate Weaponry is a physics-based, open-world VR game that redefines medieval combat with a focus on realistic technique, strength, and endurance. I learned a lot about
                        VR technology and tracking as well as the difficulty to replicate real-world physics we interact with every day. I also learned how to program AI to be responsive to 
                        specific situations and control their difficulty. I had a lot of fun researching every weapon's techniques and creating training exercises to help the player learn how to use them.

                        Marine Training Simulator is a very basic 2-player local First Person Shooter. I learned how to make several different features like ricocheting lasers off shields, creating 
                        corresponding UI elements and indicators for each player. These indicators are for when the player can dash and when the player can shoot. I also learned a lot about raycasting. 
                        There were many frustrations and bugs that I had to work through in such a short time frame, but I had lots of fun seeing how much fun my classmates had playing it.

                        Brain Rot is a short VR game where you are sitting in a classroom listening to a lecture. During the lecture, brain rot videos start popping up around the player, creating visual 
                        and audio distractions. The player must delete these brain rots and score 100% on the quiz at the end of the lecture. This project started my drive for VR and what I can create 
                        on that platform. So I learned the basics of VR, picking objects up, and snapping objects to certain locations. I had lots of fun playing it and eliminating the brain rots.

                                This is a rotoscoped video of the life of a female human in their first 22 years. This video took many hours to edit because I did not properly film each scene to make the 
                                rotoscoping easier. I learned a lot about the importance of proper film techniques and a change in workflow. I had created a scene then filmed rather than the other way. 
                                I had fun when we filmed each scene with the help of my friends and family, and then to see the final product.

                                I learned a lot about the basics of the Unity Engine and the C# language. I had a lot of fun creating this game and learning about the engine. I also had a lot of fun playing 
                                the game; my highest score is 82.

                                and Premiere Pro. I also learned the importance of non-destructive editing. I had fun watching the video I completed and getting reactions from my friends who watched it.
