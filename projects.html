                            Marine Training Simulator is a very basic 2-player local First Person Shooter. I learned how to
                            make several different features like ricocheting lasers off shields, creating corresponding UI elements
                            and indicators for each player. These indicators are for when the player can dash and when the player can shoot.
                            I also learned a lot about raycasting. There were many frustrations and bugs that I had to work through in such a short time frame,
                            but I had lots of fun seeing how much fun my classmates had playing it.

                        Brain Rot is a short VR game where you are sitting in a classroom listening to a lecture. During
                        the lecture, brain rot videos start popping up around the player, creating visual and audio distractions.
                        The player must delete these brain rots and score 100% on the quiz at the end of the lecture.
                        This project started my drive for VR and what I can create on that platform. So I learned the basics of VR,
                        picking objects up, and snapping objects to certain locations. I had lots of fun playing it and eliminating the brain rots.

                            Soul Burden was made for a collegiate Game Jam in 2 weeks near the end of the school year.
                            This 2D Platformer is inspired by the legend of Phosphorus, where the player moves through
                            Tartarus leading their last figure of humanity safely through the underworld while solving
                            puzzles, fight enemies, and battle Greek Gods. I learned a lot about player movement, a
                            following companion, and the code for the first boss of the game Persephone.

                            This is a 2D platformer with you playing as an Astronaut. A drone is shooting you as you
                            collect coins; the goal is 100. This was the first game I made in Unity. So, I learned
                            a lot about the basics of the Unity Engine and the C# language. I had a lot of fun creating
                            this game and learning about the engine. I also had a lot of fun playing the game; my highest score is 82.
